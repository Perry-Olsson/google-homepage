Intro project for HTML/CSS<br>
This is a simple (very simple) recreation of the HTML and CSS that make up the google homepage. Although the page doesn't actually do anything creating it was still a really good way to begin working with element positioning in HTML/CSS. There's obviously still a lot to learn, especially when it comes to designing dynamic webpages, but getting the page to really look like google still presented a couple good (beginner) challenges. Namely, positioning the little search and microphone icons inside the search box, and fixing the footer to the bottom of the page. Everything else was relatively simple, but despite the underlying simplicity (fussing with margins/padding etc.) I could definitely see room for creativity with the use of selectors/nesting to produce an easier to read stylesheet and one that gets the same job done with less actual code. All in all it was a solid intro to HTML/CSS.
